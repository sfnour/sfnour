### hello friend!

I'm Nour, a third-year Computer Science student @ Concordia University.

I've mostly worked with front-end technologies, but I am also learning full-stack, databases and Android development. My interests span from the intersection of ethics & technology to human-computer interactions, with mathematics somewhere in the midde.

When I am not crying about my code, you can catch me reading or getting a third cup of coffee.
